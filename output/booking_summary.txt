The getaway in Bukovel offers spacious, clean rooms with stunning views and a helpful staff. The kitchenette allows for simple cooking. The rooftop pool, though not large, is heated and provides a relaxing experience with beautiful views. Paid parking is the only downside, clearly stated in booking conditions. Free parking would enhance the experience.
