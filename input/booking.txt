Perfect place for a getaway for several days in Bukovel. Amazing location, and very helpful staff. The room was very spacious and clean, with a great view. The kitchenette is super for cooking something simple when you don't want to go out to eat. Rooftop pool is not huge, but it's heated and more than enough to relax and enjoy the views. There is really little else to wish for from a mountain hotel.
The parking is for a fee. It's mentioned in the booking conditions, so it wasn't a surprise - but I still think guests should enjoy free parking. No other downsides for us.
